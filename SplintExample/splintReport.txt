splintExample.c: (in function main)
splintExample.c:5:12: Variable c used before definition
  An rvalue is used that may not be initialized to a value on some execution
  path. (Use -usedef to inhibit warning)
splintExample.c:5:12: Suspected infinite loop.  No value used in loop test (c)
                         is modified by test or loop body.
  This appears to be an infinite loop. Nothing in the body of the loop or the
  loop test modifies the value of the loop test. Perhaps the specification of a
  function called in the loop body is missing a modification. (Use -infloops to
  inhibit warning)
splintExample.c:7:9: Assignment of int to char: c = getchar()
  To make char and int types equivalent, use +charint.
splintExample.c:8:13: Test expression for if is assignment expression: c = 'x'
  The condition test is an assignment expression. Probably, you mean to use ==
  instead of =. If an assignment is intended, add an extra parentheses nesting
  (e.g., if ((a = b)) ...) to suppress this message. (Use -predassign to
  inhibit warning)
splintExample.c:8:13: Test expression for if not boolean, type char: c = 'x'
  Test expression type is not boolean. (Use -predboolothers to inhibit warning)
splintExample.c:14:17: Fall through case (no preceding break)
  Execution falls through from the previous case (use /*@fallthrough@*/ to mark
  fallthrough cases). (Use -casebreak to inhibit warning)
